# Story-Mode
This was the recreation of the first program I made, the same program that made me interested in computer science itself.
I made this C program around 2021, then the PC got reformatted. I forgot to save the source code (dammit)
So I made it back, while adding some changes to it.



"Storymode" files - the recovered files of the original program. I got to save the .exe file, but some of the data are gone forever.


"Story-Mode" files - the remake version. It's a multiple-choice story game (It's like Visual Novel, but no VIsuals?)


"The Pictures" files - displaying the ASCII art used in the game. The original drawings (except for the fox pic) are made by me, I used a website (www.text-image.com) to convert them int ASCII art.
